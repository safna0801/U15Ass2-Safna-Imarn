        <p>At Slovensk√© Vzdel√°vacie Centrum ‚Äì South Manchester, we believe that Slovak culture should be experienced, not just learned.

        <p>Some come for the cultural experience, some come to practice their Slovak, and others just come to enjoy good company over a coffee or a glass of wine. Whatever your reason, you are always welcome.</p>
